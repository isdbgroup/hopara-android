        Within the boundaries of Hamilton lie several significant historic Maori sites.
        These sites range in type from Pa, Urupa, and Papakainga.  The majority of these sites
        were constructed by the people of Ngati Wairere or its sub-tribes.  Many of the sites are
        in close proximity to the Waikato river and Hamilton CBD, and are either designated as
        parks or reserves.  Some sites are currently occupied by buildings.  Pukete Pa is one
        example of a fortified Pa located at Braithwaite park, on the west bank of the waikato
        river at Pukete Road.  Another Major Pa site located within the Hamilton CBD on London
        street is Kirikiriroa Pa.
